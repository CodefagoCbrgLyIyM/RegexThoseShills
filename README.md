# RegexThoseShills

## Requirements
1. 4Chanx: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4chan-x/ohnjgmpcibpbafdlkimncjhflgedgpam?hl=en-US

## Usage
1. Open the 4chanx settings via the wrench on the top of any board.
2. Go to the Filters section of 4chanx via the navigation on the top left of the settings popup
3. Using the drop down with the initial value of "Guide" switch to "Comments"
4. Copy and paste the contents of regex.txt into there.
5. Refresh page and profit.


##Future plans (maybe)
1. Standalone filter with auto updating lists, maybe just fork 4chanx to do this.
2. Create filters for threads.
